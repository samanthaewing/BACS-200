    <h1>A Tribute to Navy Seaman - my Grandpa Johnson</h1>
    <center><img src="https://finessedesign.tech/solutions/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Hero-e1580052065239.jpg" alt="Honorable Hero: Grandpa Johnson"></center>
    <p>
        The hero that I admire most is my very own grandpa, U.S. Navy Gunner’s Mate first class, Harold Owen Johnson. My grandpa was a Navy Seaman who loved his God and his Country. Not only did he embody the virtue of courage in the Atlantic, but he was also heralded as an honorable hero to his family where he left a legacy of love and devotion that was unwavering and unconditional.

        My grandpa served in Puerto Rico, on the USS Tate, and most significantly, on the USS Guadalcanal “Little Flat Top” in World War II. He was a part of the Naval Task force charged with finding German U-boats and stopping them from wreaking havoc on merchant resupply vessels in the Atlantic. The height of his honorable quest was hailed when his crew aboard “Little Flat Top” captured the German submarine U-505 in June of 1944. This capture marked a turning point in the Naval war because the German communication encryption machine, called an Enigma machine, was found on the U-505 which allowed our military to listen in on the German communications and to know their plans. This was so significant to the war that there are books and movies about this capture. My grandpa was very proud of that valiant victory but was always bothered by the fact that he and his shipmates were threatened with death if they told anyone because it was to be kept top secret. The submarine is now on display at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.

        Other reasons I regard my grandpa as a hero have nothing to do with combat and everything to do with the amazing man he was in his ordinary life. Here are just a few admiring qualities he possessed:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>A man of honor: He was smart, trustworthy, and faithful.</li>
        <li>A man of devotion: His devotion to my grandma and our family was evident in all he did.</li>
        <li>A man with a big heart: My grandpa was a selfless man, you never heard him complain about anyone, and he always came to all our sports and activities (a 2 hour drive each way - he did this every week.)</li>
        <li>And the list goes on...</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        My grandpa’s spirit lives on in the family he was so proud of. He passed on his legacy of courage in many family members who have followed in his footsteps by joining the military to fight the good fight for the Country my grandpa loved. My Uncle Dan, cousin Daneta, and my brother, Owen, have all fought in wars to defend our freedom just like grandpa did. His honor lives on in his family who strives to love with the same selfless, unwavering love that seemed so natural for him to display towards my grandma and our family. His devotion is one that we all can only hope to mimic in our own families. My grandpa’s courage, honor, and devotion are his legacy that lives on through the family he loved.
