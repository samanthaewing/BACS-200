    <h2>Dangers of Technology</h2>

        Technology can be such a wonderful thing…we can find anything at our fingertips through the world wide web, our temperature can regulate based on when we arrive home, our personal assistant Alexa, can tell us any facts, online shops, you name it. We live in a time of convenience and tech bells and whistles are a huge part of that. However, not all that comes with technology is beneficial. In fact, some of it is harmful. I’m going to cover 4 major dangers of technology in this video. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Poor mental health:</b>
            Danger number 1 is that technology, specifically social media, can contribute to poor mental health. Sure social media is great for networking, sharing ideas, having fun, and getting our news. However, Technology addiction is becoming major concern in mental health circles, with suggestions of links to anxiety and depression. Arguably the worst culprit is social media addiction, with young people particularly vulnerable. A study by the National Institute of Mental Health has found a strong and significant association between social media use and depression. Another study suggests that as mobile phone use increases, so does anxiety. With the value put on likes or “hearting” pictures or the desire to have a tiktoc video go viral, social media can be a major cause of low self-esteem. This can be particularly harmful for young people and teens who are trying to discover who they are and where they fit into this world. One of the most dramatic impacts of technology is the decline of the quality and quantity of sleep. Just as watching TV into the night can be harmful, so, too, can the constant glow of our phones in our faces we just can’t put down our devices.

            <b>Burglaries, Privacy and Security:</b> Danger number 2 is our safety in the online environment. How often do we see people post that they are out of town for the weekend, post pictures of ourselves on trips, etc. This is an open door invitation for burglary to happen especially if social media settings are set to publicIf being misused, technology can expose you to a number of risks. Especially vulnerable are kids. One in three teenagers reported being victims of cyberbullying. The offenders use text messages, social media or forums to reach out the target. The internet is now also where online sex crimes take place. Sexting is another risky behavior that many teen are exposed to. Predators can also easily target teens via online platforms with private messaging. With huge population using the Internet, it gives rise to cybercrime. Today it’s easier than ever before to find someone’s personal information as the borders of privacy is blurred. With a few clicks, you can now discover Facebook page with all the contact information, pictures, whereabouts and many more. The information obtained can be used by cheaters for hacking and viruses. Data breaches are becoming more and more common as well as hackers find new ways to steel credit card and other personal data. Credit and debit card info can also easily be stolen through skimming, fraudulent phone calls, and phishing emails.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Distraction:</b>
            The number 3 danger of technology that I’d like to address is the distraction is causes. Using devices while on the road is a major cause for accidents and a threat to safety on the road to you and others. Teens who are just learning to drive, have the added issue of having their phones distract them while trying to navigate the roadways. Add to that, the in car navigation systems that are supposed to free our hands, but can actually distract us as well. A huge number of accidents occur because of cell phone distraction. In 2016, 32 people were killed and 105 seriously injured in crashes involving a driver being distracted by their mobile phone. As smartphone addiction increases, we are probably likely to see the number of traffic accidents increase.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Social Skills:</b>
            Although we think of social media as a way to socialize and interact with one another, it may be causing us to actually lose those social skills that help us to interact when we are around others. What is even more serious is that people become addicted to technology, it is their families, friends, and social lives that suffer. It can destroy the bonds and relationships we have if we aren’t careful. People are losing the ability to interact face to face. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen couples on dates that are sitting across from each other, not speaking, on their separate devices. Or, a group of teens are together, sitting around a table, no one speaking, because they are all on their devices. How sad and how superficial. On the face of it, technology appears to create global network bringing people together. But in fact, this replaces real-life communication and ends in social isolation. Moreover, strong social bonds are replaced with a number of shallow “friends” in social networks. As a result, people might feel lonely and depressed.

    <p>I’m not suggesting all technology go away because we see some risks from it, but I think we need to be aware of the risks in order to combat them whether it is limiting the time we are on our devices, not allowing the use of technology when we are in our rooms ready to go to sleep, being cautious of what we put out there about our whereabouts, or protecting our financial information. With the power of technology comes great responsibility. Thank you for watching. </p>
