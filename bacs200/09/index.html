                            Leanna’s Closet is a non-profit project of Weld Women2Women that is dedicated to assisting women in need with work related clothing for job interviews and first days on the job.

            <p>Leanna always was dressed in beautiful clothing and accessories. After she passed away, her family and friends discovered that there was need for a community closet for women who were trying to better themselves, specifically for entry or re-entry into the workforce.</p>
            <p>Leanna’s Closet was born from the desire to meet that need and to create a legacy. After 10 years, in 2012, unfortunately Leanna’s Closet closed its doors due the lack of a stable location.</p>
            <p>Five years later, in May 2017, a small group of community women saw the need and decided to re-open Leanna’s Closet under the same mission; helping women build a better life themselves.</p>
            <p>With the help of Greeley Area Habitat for Humanity ReStore, Leanna’s Closet is now in a stable location in the back of their store located at 2400 29th Street in Greeley, Colorado.</p>
            <p>Leanna’s Closet offers a one-time gift of three outfits to any woman who provides proof of residency in Weld County. No voucher is required.</p>
            <p>Working under the umbrella of Weld Women2Women seems to be a perfect partnership. W2W has provided immediate one-time financial assistance to local women through a referral and application system in cooperation of other 501©3 organizations.</p>
            <p>Partnering with W2W has been an easy connection to make as both charities can quickly provide their services in a minimal amount of time, resulting in making a positive local impact immediately.</p>
