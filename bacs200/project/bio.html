            <p>Ray and Caiti have been a part of outreach to youth for the past 13 years and their passion for young people, at both the middle and high school ages, has always been a focal point of their journey through ministry as well. Ray and Caiti each hold Bachelor's Degrees from the University of Northern Colorado; Ray in Communication Studies with a minor in Business Administration, Caiti in English Liberal Arts with a minor in Business Administration. They love spending time with their three children, Emaleigh, Elijah, and Eydan. Together they love: camping, watching movies, and generally just being silly. Ray also has an unhealthy obsession with the Back to the Future movies and loves riding motorcycles, while Caiti is probably the most talented cake designer youâ€™ll ever meet, even while doing the moonwalk across the kitchen floor. Outside of Mosaic Ray works full-time as a Marketing and Sales Ninja for the motorcycle and powersports industry, and Caiti is a Paraprofessional at the local Elementary School.</p>
