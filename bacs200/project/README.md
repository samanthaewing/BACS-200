For my project, I am creating a web site for my brother-in-law who is staring a Youth Leadership Summit. He and my sister-in-law are youth pasters at Mosaic Church currently. Here is their bio: https://greeleymosaic.com/ray-caiti The goal for this project is to give them some elements and pieces that they can use for their own site. If they like all of it, they can keep it all for free, of course. I thought if I elected to try to help someone who wanted to get their site up and going it would give me some extra incentive to put my all into this project. I hope to contribute to their objective of getting their site up and going so they can check that off their list in order to accomplish the youth leadership summit soon. 

The 5+ W3Schools tricks I added for week 3 include:
1) The images across the top of of the bio page
2) The event widget in the about page
3) The event purchase tickets in the events page
4) The image carousel on the home page (I had this already, but made significant changes to it)
5) The social media icons on the footer
6) Image and buttons linked up at the bottom of the home screen
7) The contact us portion of the bio page
